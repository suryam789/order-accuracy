## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker 24.0+ with Compose V2
- Intel GPU
- 32GB+ RAM recommended
- Intel Xeon or equivalent CPU

### Setup Test Data (Required)

Before running the application, you must prepare your test data:

1. **Add Images**: Place your food tray images in the `images/` folder
   - Supported formats: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`
   - Images should clearly show the food items on the tray

2. **Update Orders**: Edit `configs/orders.json` with your test orders
   - Each order should have an `order_id` and list of `items`
   - Order IDs should match your image filenames

3. **Update Inventory**: Edit `configs/inventory.json` to match your menu items
   - Define all possible food items that can appear in orders
   - Include item names, categories, and any relevant metadata

> **Note**: The `images/` folder does not contain sample images by default. You must add your own images before testing.

### 1. Setup OVMS Model (First Time Only)

The VLM model must be exported before running the application:

```bash
cd order-accuracy/ovms-service
./setup_models.sh    # Export model (30-60 min first time)
```

This step:
- Downloads Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct from HuggingFace (~7GB)
- Converts to OpenVINO format with INT8 quantization
- Creates model files in `ovms-service/models/`

> **Note**: This only needs to be done once. The model files are shared between dine-in and take-away applications.

### 2. Configure Environment

```bash
cd ../dine-in
make init-env
# Edit .env if needed (defaults work for most setups)
```

### 3. Build and Start

**Option A: Using Registry Images (default)**
```bash
make build      # Pull image from registry
make up         # Start services
```

**Option B: Build Locally from Source**
```bash
make build REGISTRY=false   # Build and tag as intel/order-accuracy-dine-in:2026.0-rc1
make up REGISTRY=false      # Start using locally built image
```

| Image | Tag |
|-------|-----|
| `intel/order-accuracy-dine-in` | `2026.0-rc1` |

### 4. Access Services

| Service | URL | Purpose |
|---------|-----|--------|
| Gradio UI | http://localhost:7861 | Interactive order validation |
| Order Accuracy API | http://localhost:8083 | REST API endpoints |
| API Docs | http://localhost:8083/docs | Swagger/OpenAPI documentation |
| OVMS VLM | http://localhost:8002 | VLM model server |

## Benchmarking

### Prerequisites

Initialize the performance-tools submodule before running benchmarks:

```bash
make update-submodules
```

### Quick Test

> **Prerequisite:** Services must be running. Start them first with `make up`.

```bash
make benchmark-single IMAGE_ID=MCD-1001    # Quick single image test
```

### Full Benchmark

```bash
make benchmark           # Run Order Accuracy benchmark
```

> **Note**: `make benchmark` uses Docker profiles to start worker containers. Both the `dine-in` app and `dinein-worker` services use the **same Docker image** (built from the same Dockerfile). The worker is simply the same container running `worker.py` instead of the UI.

### Stream Density Test

```bash
make benchmark-density   # Find max concurrent validations
```

> **Note**: `make benchmark-density` runs a Python script locally that sends concurrent HTTP requests to the running `dine-in` API. No separate worker containers are needed for this mode.

### Metrics Processing

```bash
make consolidate-metrics # Consolidate results to CSV
make plot-metrics        # Generate visualization plots
```

See [Get Started](docs/user-guide/get-started.md) for detailed benchmark configuration options.

## Cleanup

```bash
make down           # Stop all services
make clean          # Stop and remove volumes
make clean-images   # Remove dangling Docker images
make clean-all      # Remove all unused Docker resources
```
