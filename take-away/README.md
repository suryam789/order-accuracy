## Overview

Take-Away Order Accuracy is an AI-powered vision system that validates drive-through and take-away orders in real-time using Vision Language Models (VLM). The system processes video feeds from multiple stations simultaneously, detecting items in order bags and validating them against expected orders.

### Key Capabilities

- **Real-Time Video Processing**: GStreamer-based pipeline with RTSP support
- **Multi-Station Parallel Processing**: Concurrent order validation across multiple stations
- **VLM-Based Item Detection**: Qwen2.5-VL-7B for visual product identification
- **Intelligent Frame Selection**: YOLO-powered frame selection for optimal VLM input
- **Semantic Matching**: Hybrid exact/semantic matching for robust item comparison
- **Production-Ready Architecture**: Circuit breaker, exponential backoff, health monitoring

### Service Modes

| Mode | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Single** | Single worker with Gradio UI | Development, testing, demos |
| **Parallel** | Multi-worker with VLM scheduler | Production, high throughput |

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker 24.0+ with Compose V2
- Intel hardware (CPU, iGPU, dGPU, NPU)
- 32GB+ RAM recommended
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) (`sudo apt install make`)
- **Python 3** (`sudo apt install python3`) - required for video download and validation scripts
- Sufficient disk space for models, videos, and results

### 1. Configure

```bash
cd take-away

cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — set TARGET_DEVICE, OPENVINO_DEVICE, and other settings

# Initialize git submodules (for benchmark tools)
make update-submodules
```

### 2. Setup OVMS Model (First Time Only)

The VLM model must be exported before running the application. The script reads `take-away/.env`, so complete step 1 first.

```bash
cd ../ovms-service
./setup_models.sh    # Downloads and exports model (~30-60 min first time)
cd ../take-away
```

This step:
- Downloads Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct from HuggingFace (~7 GB)
- Converts to OpenVINO INT8 format
- Downloads YOLO and EasyOCR models
- Creates model files in `ovms-service/models/` and `take-away/models/`

> **Note**: Only needed once. Model files are shared between dine-in and take-away.

### 3. Build and Start

```bash
# Pull images from registry (default)
make build && make up

# OR build locally from source
make up REGISTRY=false
```
